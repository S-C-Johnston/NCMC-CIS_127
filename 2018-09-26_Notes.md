#Key concepts
- Risk management and approaches
- Business Impact Analysis (BIA)
- Business Continuity Plan (BCP)
- Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)
- Impact and managing risk
- Adherance to compliance

##Business Impact Analysis -- BIA
Analysis of an org's functions and activities that classifies them as critical
or noncritical.
- Identifies the impact if an IT function fails
- Identifies the priority of different critical systems

###BIA Recovery Goals and Requirements
- Recovery point objective (RPO)
- Recovery time objective (RTO)
- Business recovery requirements
- Technical recovery requirements

##BCP
A written plan for a structured response to any events that interrupt critical
functions.
Priorities:
1. Safety and well-being of people
2. Continuity of critical business functions
3. Continuity of IT infrastructure

###BCP, elements of
- Policy statement
- Project team members with defined roles
- Emergency response procedure
- Situation and damage assessment
- Resources salvage
- Alternate facilities or triage for short/long-term emergency mode of operations
	+ Easier now with the increasing presence of cloud-based storage and
	  computing

##DRP
Disaster:
- An event that affects multiple business process for an extended period
- Causes substantial resource damage
DRP:
- Includes specific steps and procedures to recover
- Is part of a BCP
- Extends and supports the BCP

Hot site: Ready to go right away. Has almost identical if not outright cloned
facilities of the primary site.

Warm site: Has at least some utilities and hardware which can be used to
recover.

Cold site: Has basic utilities but no infrastructure components

Mobile site: Trailer with necessary utilities, can be either warm or cold.

##Assessing R, T and V
- Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems (NIST SP800-30)
- CCTA Risk analysis and Management Method (CRAMM)
- Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation (OCTAVE)
- ISO/IEC 27005 "Information Security Risk Management"

##Adhering to Compliance Laws
- Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)
- Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
- Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)
- Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
- Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA)
- Government Information Security Reform Act (Security Reform Act) of 2000

**Ensuring availability and integrity is important, and you can't undo a
confidentiality violation.**

##Two factor ID
Two factors, among what you know, who you are, what you have, etc, to authenticate

###Authentication
- Passwords/Pins
- Smart cards/tokens
- Biometric
- Digital certificate
- Challenge-response handshakes
- Kerberos
- One-time passwords

###Authorization controls
- Authentication server rules/permissions
- ACLs
- IDS/IPS
- Physical access control
- Connection/access policy filters
- Network traffic filters

##Mobility and BYOD
- Data ownership
- Support ownership
- Antivirus
- Privacy
- User acceptance
- Legal concerns
