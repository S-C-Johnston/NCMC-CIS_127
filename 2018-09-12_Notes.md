# IoT

Internet of Things. Either devices or other "things" that are connected in some
way, not necessarily through standard computer interfaces.

Increasingly many services are available through the internet.
 - VoIP
 - IM Chat
 - Location data. Especially through:
	* Social media
	* Images which tag GPS location
	* Phones and fitness apps outfitted with GPS data
 - Collaboration

Impetus for the development of IoT
 - IP-based networking
 - Connectivity
 - Smaller/faster computers
 - Cloud computing
 - Data analytics

Store-and-Forward vs Real-Time
 - Real-time: Occurs instantaneously
 - Store-and-Forward: Acceptable delay in transmitting communication
	* Fitbit used to be connected to a computer directly through USB,
	  rather than being networked.

IoT's impact on humans
 - Health monitoring and updating
 - Home security and smart homes
 - Online family member calendars
 - Near real-time tracking and monitoriing via GPS
 - Online banking, bill paying, and financial transaciton
 - Online e-commerce purchases

IoT's impact on business
 - Retail stores
 - Virtual workplace
 - Remote sensors
 - Traffic-monitoring
 - B2C service delivery model
 - "Anything as a Service" IoT applications

### Evolution of Brick and Mortar to E-Commerce
 - E-Commerce: Sale of goods and services on the internet
 - Business to Consumer (B2C): Customers purchase goods and services directly
   from the website
 - Business to Business (B2B): Businesses conduct sales with other businesses
 - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS): Protects private
   customer data

Internet business challenges
 - Growing the business through the internet
 - Changing an existing conventional business into an e-business
 - Building secure and highly available websites and e-commerce portals
 - Building a web-enabled customer-service strategy
 - Finding new customers with internet marketing

### BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) policy
 - Employees and contractors using their own personal devices to connect to
   network at office.

Presents issues of:
 - Networking
 - Usability
 - Security

Security challenges of IT devices
 - Deployed in large quantities
 - Ubiquitous and can have wide reach into the user or household population
 - Not maintained or updated devices present vulnerabilities.
 - Upgrades can be difficult to distribute and deploy
 - No owner visibility of how the device connects to the internet
 - Not physically secure
 - Capture readings and measurements in the open

Privacy Challenges
 - Privacy policy statement
 - Definition of data, metadata, or analytical data use and rights
 - Ability for a user to provide consent to a manufacturer's or application
   service provider's privacy policy statement
 - Determining the domain of privacy
