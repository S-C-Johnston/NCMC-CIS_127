What it says on the tin. Even though the git log will show these commits are
recent, this material is all from several years ago. I'm simply too lazy to go
through and attemp to backdate 4 year old material. I've omitted the original
pdfs to which I do not have copyright, such as NIST standards, etc. All
material in this repository should consist of my original notes, pdfs, scripts,
etc.

This is all source-viewable, both in part as a reference resource and as a
portfolio entry, but I reserve copyright.
