Steps:
 1. Information gathering
	- Understand the topography of the network as much as possible
 2. Find a foothold
	- Open port which can be compromised
	- Gaining a backdoor on a user's machine
	- Putting malware on a printer
	- etc
 3. Pivoting
	- Generally walking from one compromised point to another
	- One goal may be privilege escalation
	- Another goal may be to set up multiple access points into the network

It is likely that in a good network, the information for which you're looking
is not exposed directly to the outside, but is in a DMZ. Pivoting as a
technique or strategy may allow some access past that DMZ through some
externally-facing service.
