"Human Intelligence" -- spy

- Geeks: learn to communicate with humans.

- Why this is relevant
 + Legislators care about it, but don't know anything about it.
 + It can't just be left to the geeks.
	* It affects everyone who interacts with the internet
	* Not just a technical issue
 + It affects all sectors of our world.
- Cyber specific concerns
- Newest threats - hybrids
- A discussion

Many "attacks" aren't strictly speaking attacks. They are probes, searches,
investigations. Malware is now usually much sneakier.

If Blue Team personnel are caught up in day-to-day threats, they may be unable to catch the more dangerous systemic threats.

Level of danger/spectrum of threats
1. Individual Hackers
 + Can do damage, but unlikely to do systemic damage
 + Programs are more available than ever
 + TOR allows for anonymized browsing, and facilitates sharing tools and
   threats
2. Small Criminals
 + Mostly act in service of making a buck
 + Ransomware particularly popular
3. Organized Crime
4. Cyber Espionage
 + Can be on a smaller scale, but often on a scale of company vs company
 + Many nation-state attackers don't use traditional/physical espionage
   anymore, in favor of networked espionage attacks.
5. Terrorist use of the Internet
 + Much of the espionage necessary to plan an attack can be done over a network
   with open-source tools. 
6. Terrorist cyber Attack
 + Networked features which can be incidentally and physically dangerous are
   increasingly common.
7. Nation State Cyber Attackers
 + Fingerprints of a nation-state can make it painfully clear that it was a
   particular country responsible. International relations mean accusing a
   country without smoking-gun evidence is a bad idea.
8. Nation State Combined Cyber and Kinetic Attack

- Insider threat 
 1. Malicious 
 2. Well-intentioned but still bad
	+ Ourselves, falling for phishing attacks, similar
- Remote/Proximate threat
  What we often think of as "hacking".
 + Proximate threats are "near", such as snooping over wifi.
- Supply Chain threat
 + Poisoned electronics

Cyber specific threats
----------------------
- Mobile computing
 + Convenience is the enemy of security
- Cloud computing
 + "Out in the ether somewhere"
- Smart grid
 + Provide IoT points on the network
 + IoT needs to be secure
 + Q/A: Get legislators involved to regulate and make it safe
	* Change default settings
	* Utility providers have to put forth the effort for security
- Stuxnet / DuQu / Flame / Conflicker / Shamoon
 + Stuxnet !American/Israeli attack on uranium centrifuges which made them spin
   in a way that made the uranium unusable
 + Conficker is the largest botnet, which as far as we know right now, exists
   to replicate and spread

Other Cyber Issues
------------------
- Emails
- Encryption/Passwords/Security question
 + Encryption is not a panacea
 + Passwords need to be distinct and memorable
 + Security questions: You can lie on those. Don't share that information
   readily, and don't use otherwise easily retrieved information
- Internet of Things (IoT)
- Data Breaches
- Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)
 + Follow the org's policies
- Ransomware
 + Back up your information
- AI, Hackback

Hybrid threats

Physical pen w/ cyber angle

Q/A
---
- Privacy: Find the point of balance. It is a continued fight. Should this be
  done by regulation or by some other means.
 + Standards and techniques change too quickly for regulation to remain
   effective for long. It is often obsolete out the gate.
- Not enough is being done to disseminate security information by the government.
 + Security awareness: PSAs which have not been overly effective.
 + Security education should happen on a decentralized, localized level.
- More young wisdom needs to bleed up, and vice versa. Privacy is a concern
  which many young people do not have, but young people are less susceptible to
  spam and phishing.
- Mobile devices (smartphones) are still computers, often with less capability
  for anti-malware wiping.
 + Treat it like a computer. Have a secure password, don't go to malicious sites.
- Conclusion of at least some groups is that building in backdoors is a stupid idea.
 + Even a non-disclosed backdoor is a bad idea.
 + Security and privacy of individuals is directly related to the security of
   the internet at large.
- Passwords. Constant changing of passwords has diminishing returns, because
  people get lazy.
 + Suggestion is to think of a strong password and physically write it down
 + Don't reuse passwords for important sites
- Wifi: Just because there's a password on it doesn't mean it is secure.
- Russian 2016 hacking: Psychological warfare was much more potent than any
  cyber attack on specific voting systems.
 + "Editorial line": editor agenda. Get news from several sources.
 + Social media spreading information makes online sources more potent
