# Auditing, Testing, and Monitoring
- A compliance checklist tends to be limited by comparison with a full
  red-team/blue-team test.

Audit tests may be either manual or automated. An automated tool can make the
process faster, but a manual process may or may not be more thorough.

## Audit questions
- Are security policies sound and appropriate?
- Are there controls supporting the policies?
- Is there effective implementation and upkeep of controls?

The cycle should follow a sequence of auditing, improving, securing, and monitoring.

## Internal v External audit
- An external audit can only cover external threats, and may be insufficient.
- An internal audit will cover internal threats, but is likely to be more costly.

## Domains
1. Remote
2. WAN
3. LAN-to-WAN
4. Workstations and Users
5. LAN
6. Intranet services
7. System and Major Applications

*Reconnaissance is important. It needs to be performed before an effective attack can be made*

## Control checks
- Approval process: who grants approval for access requests?
- Authentication mechanisms: Passwords, tokens, etc?
- Password policy and enforcement: What kind of password may be used? How
  often, if at all, must it be reset?
- Monitoring: Reading through the logs of various devices and end-points.
- Remote access systems: telnet v ssh.

## Post-Audit
- Data analysis
- Generation of audit report
	+ Findings
	+ Recommendations
	+ Timeline for implementation
	+ Level of risk
	+ Management response
	+ Follow-up
- Presentation of findings

## Monitoring
- Baselines: The only way many abnormalities can be determined is by comparison
  with an expected baseline.
- Alarms, alerts, and trends
- CCTV
- Systems which spot irregular behavior

## NIDS and HIDS
Network Intrusion Detection System and Host Intrusion Detection System
