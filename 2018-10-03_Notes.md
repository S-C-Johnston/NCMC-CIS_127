# Nation State Exploiters

## Reconnaissance 
- Keep information as private as possible.
- Be aware of who is watching
- Reduce the attack surface. 
- Attackers will see what is actually running on a network, as opposed to what
  you intended to be on a network. 
- Patch up holes and vulnerabilities.
- Be aware of the network boundary. Cloud based services, BYOD, and telecommuting make that boundary blurry and stretchy.

## Initial exploit
- Keep software updated. Known vulnerabilities are dangerous.
- Carefully watch frequently used vectors, like email, USB drives, etc.
- Don't rely on the users to do the right thing.
- Use best practices for defense.
- Make it difficult to steal credentials, like using 2FA.
- Least privileges for accounts.
- Admin credentials in scripts are bad news.
- Drive old protocols which are insecure out of your system. Sending
  credentials over cleartext is bad.
- Keep and look at logs

## Establish persistence
- Consider whitelisting, prevent rootkits, etc, from running.
	+ Against nation-states, it may not be enough to block that which is
	  known to be bad.
	+ Block the things which are not known to be good.

## Move laterally
- Close off paths internally to prevent pivoting.
- Carefully consider the trust of devices and services.
	+ Especially considering BYOD
- Monitoring inside the network is important

## Collect, Exfil and Exploit
- Keep offsite backups
- Have a plan for data destruction
- Criminals are often opportunistic, the nation state creates their own
  opportunities with persistence.

# Whitelist and Blacklist
A whitelist only allows that which is on the list. A blacklist denies that which is on the list.
- Whitelist: more secure, but also more difficult to manage accessibility as
  the needs of an org grow.
- Blacklist: Easy to implement, but inherently limited to that which is known.

## Security administration
- Responsible for planning, desigining, implementing, etc an org's security plan

## Controlling access
- Identification
- Authentication: Are you who you say you are?
- Authorization: What can you access?
- Accountability: Logging access to things.

## Documentation, Procedures
Most common documentation requirements include:
- Sensitive assets list
- Org's security process
- Authority of the people responsible for security
- Policies, procedures, and guidelines adopted by the org
An Org must comply on two levels, with regulatory and organizational
compliance.

## Outsourcing
Advantages:
- High level of expertise
Disadvantages:
- Consultant may not possess internal knowledge
- Won't develop in-house capacity or talent. Become reliant on consultants

### Concerns
- Privacy
- Risk
- Data Security
- Ownership
- Adherence to policy

## Common agreements
Consultants need to also be held to agreements vis a vis the regulations.
- Service-level Agreement (SLA)
- Blanket purchase agreement

## Ethics
- Set the example
- Encourage adopting ethical guidelines and standards
- Inform users through security training
	+ Users are the weakest link, but we shouldn't neglect their
	  understanding.

## Principles
- Limit access
- Separation of duties
- Job rotation
- Mandatory vacations
- Training
- Security awareness
- Social engineering

## Security Policy
Very rarely does only one person have a say in the policy structure. To dangerous effect, that one person may be the non-technical CEO or other suit.

It all starts with policy, much of which is in a "cover your ass" fashion. A policy helps to keep the professionals accountable, rather than arbitrary implementation.
