Cryptography
============

Processing cleartext (unencrypted) information through a cryptographic filter
to get cyphertext.

Cleartext also called plaintext

Cyphertext also called ciphertext

## Symmetric keys
Using the same key to lock and unlock cyphertext. One way of doing this
physically is to have synchronized pads of disposable keys which are
distributed before communication begins.

## Asymmetric keys
The key used to lock cyphertext cannot unlock the same cyphertext, another key
is needed. The same must be true in the other direction, too. Alice and Bob
each have a key, and those keys encrypt cyphertext such that only the
recipient, not the sender, can reverse.

## Elliptical key
Uses calculus and elliptical curves to generate keys for cryptography

## History
- Cryptography has been used for several thousand years.
- Steganography is the act of hiding information, usually in plain sight.
  Embedding information in image files, for instance.

## Objectives of using cryptography
- Privacy/confidentiality
- Integrity
- Entity authentication
- Message authentication
- Signature
