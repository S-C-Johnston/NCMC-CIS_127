# Access Controls
Used to protect a resource so that it is used only by those authorized to do
so.

## Four parts
1. Identification
2. Authentication
3. Authorization
4. Accountability

## Two types
1. Physical
	- Access to physical space or assets
2. Logical
	- Access to digital or intangible assets

Subject -> Reference Monitor <-> Security Kernel Database (Access Control list)
Ref monitor -> Audit Log, Object

## Access Control Policies
Four parts of policy
1. Users
2. Resources: Protected assets
3. Actions: Activities that authorized users can perform
4. Relationships: Optional conditions that exist between users and resources.
   Ownership, etc.

## Authentication types
- Knowledge
- Ownership
- Characteristics
- Location
- Action

## Biometrics
Concerns about biometric include Accuracy, Reaction time, and acceptability

Methods include:
- Fingerprint
- Palm print
- Hand geometry
- Retina/Iris scan
- Facial recognition
- Voice pattern
- Keystroke dynamics
- Signature dynamics

## Single Sign-On
- Sign on to a service/computer/etc once
- Identification and Authorization credentials allow user to access all computers and systems where authorized
- Reduces human err
- Difficult to implement

## Models of access control
- Discretionary Access control (DAC): A user can change the permissions on
  their own files and share them as seen fit
- Mandatory Access Control (MAC): Permission to access an asset and change
  those permissions is determined by the sensitivity of the asset. MAC is
stronger than DAC.
- Nondiscretionary: Controls are monitored closely by the security administrator.
- Rule-based: List of rules determines which users have access.
