Network
=======

## Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model
1. Physical -- Signaling
2. Data Link -- Physical addressing; LAN delivery
3. Network -- Routing data; logical addressing; WAN delivery
4. Transport -- End-to-end communication maintenance
5. Session -- Interprocess communication
6. Presentation -- Data format; encryption
7. Application -- User Interface

## Two types of networks
1. WAN -- Wide area network. Such threats are usually remote
 - It is expensive to build one's own wired WAN.
 - Solutions include line-of-sight transmission, or some other radio
   transmission
 - Providers have an uptime-agreement
 - Cable modems are typically asymmetric, with higher download speeds than
   upload
2. LAN -- Local area network. Threats are local

## Router placement
1. From internet to internal
2. Internet -> Firewall
3. Firewall -> Border router
   Border router handles the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)
4. Border router -> Internal router
   Internal router handles the intranet

## Hardware

Hubs send messages out to every machine in the subnet, which results in many
message collisions.

Switches send messages only to the specified machine, especially by means of the individual MAC address.

Ethernet governs both Physical and Data Link layers. Defines how computers use
MAC addresses to communicate with each other on the network

## Protocols

Transmission Control Protocol: Needs acknowledgement back and forth
User Datagram Protocol: Comparable to a flood of packets needing no confirmation

IPV4
Four-byte (32-bit) addresses that uniquely identify every device on the
network. It is still the most common

IPV6
128 bit addresses with a significantly wider address space
? More secure how?

Many older protocols are made secure by tunnelling through SSH or running on
top of SSL.

## Network risks
- Reconnaissance
- Eavesdropping
- Denial of Service (DoS)
- DDos
- Telephony denial of service (TDoS)
